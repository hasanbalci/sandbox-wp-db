## Defining pathways for Communities
The pathway set for each community at WikiPathways is defined by a text file listing all WikiPathways Identifiers (WPIDs) relevant for that community. This directory contains the lists of pathways for all currently defined communities. 

### Adding a pathway list for a new Community page
* Create a simple .txt file with the relevant WPIDs listed as one column, no header.
* Give the the .txt file a name that can also be used as the community-tag as defined in your community markdown file. These two must be identical.
* Push your changes to GitHub (if you have permissions) or create a pull request.

### Update the list of pathways for an existing Community page
* Option 1: Edit the appropriate file in your local clone of the repo, followed by a push to GitHub (if you have write permissions) or a pull request.
* Option 2: Edit the file directly in the GitHub web interface by clicking the Edit button in the upper right.
